//! Print crop/trim mark generation for pages declaring a `bleed` margin.
//!
//! When a page declares a positive bleed `b`, the media box expands to
//! `(w + 2b) × (h + 2b)` and the trim box is the inner rectangle
//! `[b, b, w, h]`. Standard crop marks are an L-shaped bracket of two short
//! line segments at each of the four trim corners, drawn entirely OUTSIDE the
//! trim box in the surrounding bleed margin (they never cross into the trim
//! area). They are painted in a registration color (black, ~1px) on top of all
//! page content so they remain visible.
//!
//! Marks are emitted as [`SceneCommand::StrokeLine`] primitives — the IR's
//! dedicated axis-aligned line command — so each corner bracket is exactly two
//! segments and a full page yields eight segments. All geometry is computed
//! deterministically from `b`, `w`, and `h` (no floating-point nondeterminism:
//! every coordinate is an exact sum/difference of the inputs).
