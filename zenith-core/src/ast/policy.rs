//! Document-level diagnostic-policy AST types.
//!
//! A `.zen` document may carry a root `diagnostics { … }` block that adjusts how
//! specific diagnostic codes are *reported*. This is a lint-level model in the
//! spirit of rustc lint levels:
//!
//! ```text
//! diagnostics {
//!     allow "layout.off_canvas"     // suppress this advisory
//!     deny  "font.local"            // elevate to a blocking Error (CI gate)
//!     warn  "node.unknown_property" // force to Warning
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The policy affects ONLY which diagnostics are surfaced by validation — it is
//! consulted in [`crate::validate()`] and nowhere else. The scene compiler and the
//! render path never see it, so a policy can never change rendered output. A
//! document with no `diagnostics` block parses to an empty [`DiagnosticPolicy`],
//! which is an identity pass (no entries → no effect), so the default-off path is
//! byte-identical to before this feature existed.
//!
//! Bright lines (see [`crate::validate()`] for the application logic):
//! - Policy applies to **Warning**- and **Advisory**-severity diagnostics only.
//!   **Error** severity is IMMUTABLE: an `allow` never drops an Error and a
//!   `warn` never weakens an Error.
//! - **Last-wins** for duplicate codes: a later entry for the same code overrides
//!   any earlier one (exactly like rustc lint levels on the command line).
